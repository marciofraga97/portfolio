            <h4>Early education</h4>
            <p>
              I studied Graphic Design and Applied Visual Arts in Leuven,
              Belgium. There I developped my mastery of my unique style of
              making illustrations and broaden my ideas out of my mind. I began
              to expand my interests about videogames and comics to my artworks
              since I have a passionate interest about them. I use programs like
              Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign. My most used program is
              Illustrator. I also have good knowledge of Premi√®re Pro, After
              Effects and Lightroom. I even have a ton of projects that I need
              to finish...

            <h4>Late education</h4>
            <p>
              To expand my knowledge about Graphic Design, I began to learn
              about Web Design in HTML, CSS and Javascript in a course called
              Intec Brussel. It's a free 7-month course for people who have a
              large interest in IT. During the months of hard coding, I began to
              take an huge interest in Front-End Development, especially in CSS
              and Bootstrap. Since designing is in my blood, I like to visualize
              in my concepts for a better user experience in my head. But first
              of all, I need to gain a lot of self-training to be able to gain
              knowledge since programming is difficult to understand. I have
              basic knowledge of Bootstrap, Node.js, ExpressJS and React.

            <h4>What now?</h4>
            <p>
              Now I'm currently working on my own projects from time to time. We will
              see what the future beholds with my own efforts. About myself, I
              like games and art in general. I'm very kind and respectful and
              also very reserved and self-conscious. But for things that I need to reach, even with fear,
              I will be able to conquer them. :)
